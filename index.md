### CPSC 120

Lab 1 

Lab 1 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because of its simplicity yet importance to the beginning of computer science. The two words hello world are what any beginner computer scientist would first learn. I loved the lab because of how this lab was my first one to the school semester, and how it was an introduction to the world of C++.

Lab 2

In Lab 2 part 1 I learned the basics of how to add, subtract, divide, multiply, and create a variable which I could set/change the value of. In the second part, I learned how to display messages on the terminal and how to receive data through the terminal and set that input data to a variable which could be used later on. While a basic lab, I found it to be very fun learning the very basics of C++ coding. 

Lab 4

In Lab 4 part 1 I learned how to use a .cc and .h and how the two can work simultaneously when runned. The use of .cc and .h files are now used in all other labs I have completed. I really enjoyed this part of the lab because for the first time it made me feel like I was becoming a true coder.
